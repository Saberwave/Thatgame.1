I couldn't figure out how to use Cocossharp's menu functionality (particularly the use of
CCMenu and CCMenuItem, respectively). The stackoverflow answer by jaybers allowed us to create
a similar type of effect using CCSprite.

I wanted to create a tileable background using CocosSharp but had some troubles making it display properly.
In part 4 of Luke's Youtube tutorial series, he displays code that creates a repeatable background using
the CreateBackground method. The code has been altered slightly for this project, as it has different
argument requirements and variable names.
